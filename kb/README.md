# Global Knowledge Base

## Purpose
Contains cross-repo knowledge articles, shared patterns, and organizational learnings that apply beyond a single repository.

## What Belongs Here
- Shared architectural patterns
- Cross-repo integration guides
- Organization-wide best practices
- Technology stack decisions affecting multiple repos

## What Does NOT Belong Here
- Repo-specific knowledge (use `/repos/{repo}/kb/`)
- Governance policies (use `/governance/policies/`)
- Active session notes (use `/sessions/`)
- Incident resolutions (use `/ris/resolutions/`)

## Human Usage
Reference for patterns and practices that span repositories. Contribute when a learning applies beyond its origin repo.

## AI Agent Usage
Agents should:
1. Search here for cross-repo patterns before implementing
2. Suggest promotion of repo-specific learnings when they become reusable
3. Link to specific articles rather than duplicating content

## Migration Notes
- Articles promoted from `/repos/{repo}/kb/` when cross-repo relevance confirmed
- Promotion requires human approval
