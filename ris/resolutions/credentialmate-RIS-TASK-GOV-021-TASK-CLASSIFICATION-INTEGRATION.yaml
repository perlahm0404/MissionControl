# Task Classification (T0–T3) Integration

## Objective
Integrate Task Classification system (T0–T3) into all orchestration commands to auto-detect and log risk levels for all file operations.

## Classification Tiers
- **T0**: read-only/audit (no writes)
- **T1**: low-risk (governance docs, KB, RIS, metadata)
- **T2**: medium-risk (app code, scripts, logic)
- **T3**: high-risk (infra, schema, IAM, Dockerfile, secrets)

## Rules Implemented
- T0: no writes allowed
- T1–T3: require RIS task
- T3: require human approval
- PLE logs classification for all operations
- ForbiddenOps blocks unsanctioned T3 activity

## Scope
- /work.md
- /session-start.md
- /session-end.md
- /checkup.md
- /checkup-deep.md

## Implementation

### Commands Modified
- **.claude/work.md**: Added Task Classification hook, auto-detect on writes, log to PLE
- **.claude/commands/session-start.md**: Initialize session as T0, hook registration
- **.claude/commands/session-end.md**: Classification summary (T0/T1/T2/T3 distribution), verification of no unsanctioned T3 ops
- **.claude/commands/checkup.md**: Load Task Classification engine
- **.claude/commands/checkup-deep.md**: Load Task Classification engine

### Hook Behavior
- Auto-detect classification tier on every file write
- Log classification to PLE ledger
- Block unsanctioned T3 operations
- Report classification summary in session-end output

## Validation
- [x] Task Classification engine loaded in all commands
- [x] Session initialized as T0
- [x] Auto-detection hook registered
- [x] T3 verification in session-end
- [x] Classification logged to PLE
- [x] Machine-readable output includes classification_status and classification_summary
