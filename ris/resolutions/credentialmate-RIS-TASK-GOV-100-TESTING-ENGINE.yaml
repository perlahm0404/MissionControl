title: Install Testing Engine (Bundle 10)
type: governance_installation
status: completed
priority: high
created: 2025-11-28
completed: 2025-11-28
bundle: "10"
version: "1.8.3"

objective: |
  Install complete Testing & Simulation Engine with T0/T1/T2/T3 test levels,
  golden-flow regression suite, lane test runners, CI/CD integration, and
  full test automation framework.

scope:
  - Test directory structure (tests/backend, tests/frontend, etc.)
  - Test configuration (test_settings.json, mock_data.json, simulation_matrix.json)
  - Test harness governance docs (testing_engine.md, schema_test_rules.md, etc.)
  - Golden-flow regression tests (login, provider, license, compliance, document)
  - Lane-specific test runners (backend, data, worker, parser, rules, frontend, infra)
  - Mock data generators (provider, license, documents, rules)
  - Validation tools (schema_validator, api_contract_validator, migration_validator)
  - Simulation engine (simulation_engine.md, simulation_runner.py)
  - CI/CD workflow integration (pr-validate.yml, pr-goldenflow.yml)
  - Orchestrator integration (work.md, checkup.md directives)

deliverables:
  - "✓ tests/ directory structure"
  - "✓ tests/config/ (test_settings.json, mock_data.json, simulation_matrix.json)"
  - "✓ governance/testing/ (6 governance docs)"
  - "✓ tests/simulation/goldenflow/ (5 golden-flow tests)"
  - "✓ governance/lanes/{lane}/tests_runner.md (7 lane runners)"
  - "✓ tests/generators/ (4 mock generators + __init__.py)"
  - "✓ tests/tools/ (3 validators + __init__.py)"
  - "✓ tests/simulation/ (simulation_engine.md + simulation_runner.py)"
  - "✓ .github/workflows/pr-validate.yml (updated with T0/T1/T2)"
  - "✓ .github/workflows/pr-goldenflow.yml (updated with T3)"

enforcement:
  - Pre-commit hooks (T0)
  - PR CI validation (T0/T1/T2)
  - Merge to main (T3)
  - Pre-deploy (T3 re-run)
  - Lane-specific requirements enforced
  - Coverage threshold blocking (70% fail-under, 80% target)
