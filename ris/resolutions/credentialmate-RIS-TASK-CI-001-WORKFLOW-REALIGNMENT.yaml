  2. Update capsule version references to v1.8.2
  3. Update RIS path references to ris/
  4. Update KB path references to docs/kb/
  5. Test workflow validation locally
  6. Commit changes with proper RIS documentation

  1. Revert workflow files to previous commit
  2. Document failure reason
  3. Fix issues in isolation
