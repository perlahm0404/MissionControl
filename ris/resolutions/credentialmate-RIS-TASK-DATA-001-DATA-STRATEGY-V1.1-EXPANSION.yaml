## Summary
Expanded Data Strategy v1.0 with detailed content for Sections 4–8, covering entity naming conventions, versioning/migration rules, data quality/observability/lineage, PHI roadmap, and agent data-access governance. Document activated as v1.1.

## Context
- Data Strategy v1.0 created with Sections 1–3 completed (Purpose, Principles, Logical Architecture)
- Sections 4–8 were TODO placeholders
- Data and schema are the primary product moat for CREDMATE
- This expansion provides comprehensive data governance documentation for all agents

## Scope
Documentation-only expansion of `docs/kb/data-strategy-v1.0.md` (evolved to v1.1):

**Section 4: Entity Overview & Naming Conventions**
- Canonical entity names and ID patterns
- Column naming standards (snake_case, suffixes like _id, _at, _version, _score, _confidence)
- Relationship patterns (org → provider → license/document/CME)
- Reserved words and naming constraints

**Section 5: Versioning & Migration Rules**
- Migration lifecycle (create, test, review, deploy)
- Breaking vs. non-breaking changes
- Deprecation windows and compatibility layers
- Rollback strategies and backfill requirements
- Version tracking for schema, rules, and models

**Section 6: Data Quality, Observability & Lineage**
- Data quality checks and validation rules
- Monitoring and alerting for data anomalies
- Lineage tracking (OLTP → events → analytics → ML)
- Audit trail requirements for compliance
- Performance monitoring and optimization

**Section 7: Security, Privacy & PHI Roadmap**
- Current state: non-PHI only (v1.0)
- PHI introduction timeline and prerequisites
- Encryption requirements (RLS, key-managed, column-level)
- Access control patterns (tenant isolation, least privilege)
- HIPAA compliance roadmap
- Differential privacy considerations for ML

**Section 8: Governance for Agent Access**
- Agent data-access contracts tied to `governance/v10/contracts/agent-data.md`
- READ/WRITE permissions by agent (Claire, Atlas, Sentinel, Echo, Parse, Extract, Rules, Aggy, Synthesis, Forge, DATA, ML/EVAL)
- Restricted operations (no ad-hoc production writes, migration-only changes)
- Risk-based gating (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Enforcement via governed helpers and repositories

## Environments
- **All environments**: local, dev, staging, production
- **Data layers**: OLTP core, events/audit, analytics, ML/evaluation schemas
- **v1.1 scope**: Non-PHI only, but PHI-ready architecture

## Governance Constraints (Capsule v10.0)
- Documentation-only task (no code, no Terraform, no tests)
- No changes to application logic or database schema
- No production infrastructure modifications
- All content must align with existing agent contracts and governance rules
- Updates must be consistent with Capsule v10.0 data governance principles

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Section 4 completed with entity naming standards and conventions
- [x] Section 5 completed with migration lifecycle and versioning rules
- [x] Section 6 completed with data quality, observability, and lineage framework
- [x] Section 7 completed with PHI roadmap and security requirements
- [x] Section 8 completed with agent data-access governance matrix
- [x] Document status updated from DRAFT to ACTIVE (v1.1)
- [x] Cross-references added to Capsule v10.0 and agent contracts
- [x] KB index updated to include Data Strategy v1.1

## Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-11-29

**Deliverables:**
1. `docs/kb/data-strategy-v1.0.md` updated to v1.1 with all Sections 1–8 completed
2. Document status changed from DRAFT to ACTIVE
3. `governance/v10/capsule-v10.0.md` updated to reference Data Strategy v1.1
4. `governance/v10/contracts/agent-data.md` updated to reference Data Strategy v1.1
5. All acceptance criteria met

**Key Content Added:**
- Section 4: Naming conventions for tables, columns, PKs, FKs, temporal/versioning/confidence fields
- Section 5: Migration lifecycle (PROPOSE → REVIEW → TEST → DEPLOY → VERIFY), change classification, rollback requirements
- Section 6: Data quality checks, lineage tracking, audit trail requirements (SOC2/HIPAA)
- Section 7: PHI-ready architecture, encryption requirements, HIPAA compliance roadmap (4 phases)
- Section 8: Agent data-access matrix (11 agents), restricted operations, risk-based gating

**Governance Impact:**
- Establishes canonical data architecture standards for all agents
- Enables consistent schema evolution and migration practices
- Critical for PHI readiness and compliance (SOC2/HIPAA)
- Provides clear agent access boundaries and risk classification

## Related Artifacts
**Primary Artifact:**
- `docs/kb/data-strategy-v1.0.md` (v1.1 ACTIVE)

**Updated Governance:**
- `governance/v10/capsule-v10.0.md` (Section 11.3: Key KB Documents)
- `governance/v10/contracts/agent-data.md` (Primary Reference header)

**Referenced Governance:**
- `governance/v10/capsule-v10.0.md` (core data governance principles)
- `governance/v10/sec-v10.0.md` (Static Environment Contract)

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** LOW (documentation-only)

**Impact:**
- No code changes
- No database modifications
- No production environment impact
- Governance documentation enhancement only

**Importance:**
- HIGH governance value
- Establishes data architecture standards for all agents
- Enables consistent schema evolution and migration practices
- Critical for PHI readiness and compliance (SOC2/HIPAA)

## Approval & Sign-Off
**Data Lane:** ✅ Completed (DATA agent)
**Governance Lane:** ✅ Approved (Capsule v10.0 compliance verified)
**Human Approval:** Not required (documentation-only, low risk)

**Auto-Execute Authorization:** YES (Capsule v10.0, docs-only, low risk)

---

**Notes:**
- Sections 4–8 implemented with v1.1 content (naming, migrations, quality, PHI, agent access)
- Governance references and DATA agent contract updated to point to v1.1
- Document now serves as authoritative reference for all data architecture decisions
- Future enhancements (v1.2+) will expand PHI prerequisites and agent SDK formalization
