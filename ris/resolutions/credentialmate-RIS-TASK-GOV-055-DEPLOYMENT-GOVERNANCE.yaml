# Deployment Governance

## Objective
Implement manual-gated, provenance-tracked deployments to staging and production.

## Workflows
1. .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
2. .github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml

## Governance Controls
1. **Manual Dispatch Only**: No automatic deployments
2. **Approval Token Required**: Secrets-based approval mechanism
3. **Fingerprint Validation**: Capsule integrity check before deploy
4. **Post-Deploy Smoke Test**: Health check after deployment
5. **Provenance Logging**: Write deployment entry to governance/provenance/deployments/

## Provenance Fields
- timestamp
- target (staging|production)
- commit SHA
- actor
- workflow
- status

## Integration
- **PLE**: All deployments logged to provenance ledger
- **GFE**: Fingerprint validated before deploy
- **SEC**: Uses AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
