description: |
  Complete Knowledge Base (KB) harmonization for Phase 7, consolidating all KB content
  from governance/knowledge-base/ and scattered governance/*.md files into the canonical
  docs/kb/ directory structure with proper categorization.

objectives:
  - Discover all KB files across repository
  - Classify KB content by type (governance, security, automation, etc.)
  - Migrate all KB files to docs/kb/<category>/ structure
  - Archive obsolete governance versions to zdelete/
  - Create KB structure documentation
  - Update KB index with new file locations

scope:
  in_scope:
    - governance/knowledge-base/* → docs/kb/*
    - governance/*.md KB files → docs/kb/<category>/*
    - Create normalized directory structure under docs/kb/
    - Archive capsule v1.4 and old master project files
    - Update KB index and create structure guide

  out_of_scope:
    - Code refactoring
    - Breaking link updates in non-KB files
    - Migration of non-KB documentation

acceptance_criteria:
  - All KB files moved to docs/kb/ with proper categorization
  - No KB content remaining in governance/knowledge-base/
  - Obsolete governance files archived to zdelete/governance-archives/
  - KB directory structure normalized (no duplicate nested folders)
  - KB index updated with new file locations
  - KB structure v1.8.2 documentation created

implementation_summary: |
  Executed comprehensive KB harmonization:

  1. Discovery Phase:
     - Found 32 files in governance/knowledge-base/
     - Found 34 governance/*.md files with KB content
     - Found 2 existing files in docs/kb/

  2. Migration Execution:
     - Moved all structured KB subdirectories:
       * decisions/ → docs/kb/decisions/
       * implementations/ → docs/kb/implementations/
       * patterns/ → docs/kb/patterns/
       * runbooks/ → docs/kb/runbooks/
       * templates/ → docs/kb/templates/
       * troubleshooting/ → docs/kb/troubleshooting/

     - Categorized and moved loose KB files:
       * 11 files → docs/kb/governance/
       * 2 files → docs/kb/orchestration/
       * 5 files → docs/kb/security/
       * 3 files → docs/kb/automation/
       * 1 file → docs/kb/cli/
       * 7 files → docs/kb/runbooks/
       * 6 files → docs/kb/patterns/
       * 3 files → docs/kb/implementations/
       * 1 file → docs/kb/troubleshooting/

  3. Archive Operations:
     - capsule-v1.4.md → zdelete/governance-archives/
     - credmate-master-project-v-1-0-20251124.md → zdelete/governance-archives/

  4. Structure Normalization:
     - Flattened duplicate nested directories (e.g., decisions/decisions → decisions/)
     - Removed empty governance/knowledge-base/ directory
     - Created missing category directories

results:
  files_discovered: 68
  files_moved: 66
  files_archived: 2
  directories_created: 10
  final_kb_count: 67
  governance_root_remaining: 1  # capsule-v1.8.2.md (active governance)

validation:
  - ✅ All KB files successfully migrated to docs/kb/
  - ✅ No duplicate nested directories
  - ✅ Obsolete files archived to zdelete/
  - ✅ Directory structure matches spec
  - ✅ governance/knowledge-base/ removed
  - ✅ RIS task created
  - 🔄 KB structure v1.8.2.md (in progress)
  - 🔄 KB index update (in progress)

rollback_plan: |
  If rollback needed:
  1. git revert commits from this task
  2. Restore from zdelete/governance-archives/ if needed
  3. Recreate governance/knowledge-base/ structure

  Note: All operations are non-destructive (moves, not deletes)

documentation:
  - docs/kb/governance/kb_structure_v1.8.2.md (to be created)
  - docs/kb/index.md (to be updated)
  - governance/capsule-v1.8.2.md (references updated structure)

notes: |
  - Used File Placement Governance (FPG) principles
  - Applied Trusted Automation Mode (TAM) for low/medium risk operations
  - All operations executed without human approval (TAM)
  - Maintained git history through git mv operations where applicable
  - Untracked files moved with regular mv, then staged

lessons_learned:
  - KB content was scattered across 3 locations (governance/, governance/knowledge-base/, docs/kb/)
  - git mv requires files to be tracked; used regular mv for untracked files
  - Directory structure duplication occurred during initial mkdir; resolved by flattening
  - Categorization improved discoverability (automation, orchestration, cli separate from generic governance)

compliance:
  soc2_controls:
    - CC2.1: Information retention policy (KB structure)
    - CC3.1: Internal communication (documentation organization)

  governance_alignment: v1.8.2
  fpg_compliant: true
  tam_applied: true
