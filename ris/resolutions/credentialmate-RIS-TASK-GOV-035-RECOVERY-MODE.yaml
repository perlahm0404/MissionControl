description: |
  Deploy Recovery Mode module as part of Self-Healing Governance (SHG).
  Activates structured recovery protocol when previous session crashed,
  governance corruption detected, or critical drift identified.

objectives:
  - Create recovery_mode.md at governance/self-healing/
  - Define 4 activation triggers (crashed session, governance corruption, merge conflicts, manual activation)
  - Document 4-phase recovery protocol (damage assessment, safe state restoration, automated healing, validation)
  - Provide recovery output format
  - Define safety guardrails (backup branch, no force-push, preserve history)

acceptance_criteria:
  - governance/self-healing/recovery_mode.md exists and is complete
  - All 4 activation triggers documented
  - 4-phase recovery protocol defined in YAML
  - Recovery output format specified
  - Safety guardrails documented (recovery branch, no destructive ops)
  - Risk classification matrix provided (minor/moderate/severe/critical)

deliverables:
  - governance/self-healing/recovery_mode.md
  - Updated session-start.md and checkup-deep.md commands
  - RIS task documentation (this file)

kb_refs:
  - docs/kb/governance/recovery_mode_v1.8.3.md

dependencies:
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-030-SHG-ENGINE
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-031-DRIFT-REPAIR (invoked during recovery)
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-032-SESSION-LEDGER-HEALING (invoked during recovery)
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-033-KB-RIS-SYNC (invoked during recovery)
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-034-ORPHAN-SCRUBBER (invoked during recovery)

next_actions:
  - Monitor for crashed session detection during /session-start
  - Test recovery mode activation on next governance corruption
  - Review recovery incidents quarterly

notes: |
  Recovery Mode is a high-risk operation requiring careful execution.
  Creates recovery branch before any changes.
  Invokes all other SHG modules during recovery.
  All recovery actions logged to RIS incident + KB entry + session summary.
  Manual activation via /claire --recovery-mode.
