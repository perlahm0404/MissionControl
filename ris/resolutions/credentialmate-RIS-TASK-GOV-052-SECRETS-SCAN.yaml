# Secrets Governance Scan

## Objective
Implement automated secrets scanning to prevent credential leakage in PRs.

## Workflow
.github/workflows/pr-secretscan.yml

## Detection Patterns
1. AWS access keys (AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16})
2. AWS secret access keys
3. Password assignments
4. JWT secrets
5. Bearer tokens
6. .env file commits

## Behavior
- Scan diff between PR and base branch
- Block merge if secrets detected
- Create RIS incident on failure
- Manual intervention required
