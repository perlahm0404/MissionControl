description: |
  Deploy Drift Repair module as part of Self-Healing Governance (SHG).
  Auto-detects and repairs naming violations, placement errors (FPG),
  metadata drift, capsule reference drift, and index drift.

objectives:
  - Create drift_repair.md module at governance/self-healing/
  - Define drift categories (naming, placement, metadata, capsule refs, indexes)
  - Implement risk matrix for auto-fix decisions
  - Document execution flow (scan → classify → repair → report)
  - Integrate with FPG and capsule validation

acceptance_criteria:
  - governance/self-healing/drift_repair.md exists and is complete
  - All 5 drift categories documented with auto-fix actions
  - Risk matrix provided (low/medium/high)
  - Execution flow defined in YAML
  - Integration points with FPG and capsule specified
  - TAM-enabled for low/medium-risk repairs

deliverables:
  - governance/self-healing/drift_repair.md
  - Updated checkup.md and checkup-deep.md commands
  - RIS task documentation (this file)

kb_refs:
  - docs/kb/governance/drift_repair_v1.8.3.md

dependencies:
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-030-SHG-ENGINE
  - File Placement Governance (FPG) in capsule v1.8.3

next_actions:
  - Run drift repair sweep during next /checkup-deep
  - Monitor drift repair logs in session summaries
  - Update FPG rules if new drift patterns emerge

notes: |
  Drift Repair is invoked by all orchestration commands (session-start, session-end, checkup, checkup-deep, work).
  All repairs logged to PLE provenance ledger.
