description: |
  Install Self-Healing Governance (SHG) Engine as part of Bundle 3 (v1.8.3).
  SHG provides autonomous governance repair: drift detection/repair, session ledger healing,
  KB/RIS auto-sync, orphan scrubbing, recovery mode, and fingerprint repair.

objectives:
  - Create SHG core module at governance/self-healing/shg_engine.md
  - Define SHG capabilities and execution model
  - Integrate with Bundle 2 engines (PLE, Task Classification, RIM, GFE)
  - Document risk classification and TAM-enabled auto-execution
  - Define output format and maintenance protocol

acceptance_criteria:
  - governance/self-healing/shg_engine.md exists and is complete
  - SHG capabilities documented (drift repair, session healing, KB/RIS sync, orphan scrub, recovery, fingerprint)
  - Integration points with Bundle 2 engines defined
  - Risk classification matrix provided (low/medium/high/critical)
  - Output format documented in YAML
  - Referenced in capsule v1.8.3

deliverables:
  - governance/self-healing/shg_engine.md
  - Updated orchestration commands (.claude/commands/*)
  - RIS task documentation (this file)

kb_refs:
  - docs/kb/governance/self_healing_overview.md

dependencies:
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-025-BUNDLE-2-INSTALLATION

next_actions:
  - Deploy drift_repair.md module (RIS-TASK-GOV-031)
  - Deploy session_ledger_healing.md module (RIS-TASK-GOV-032)
  - Integrate SHG into all orchestration commands

notes: |
  SHG is the autonomous repair engine for CREDMATE governance.
  All SHG actions are logged to session ledgers via PLE.
  TAM-enabled for low/medium-risk repairs (no user confirmation required).
