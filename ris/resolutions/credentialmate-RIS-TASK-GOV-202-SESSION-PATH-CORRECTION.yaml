  description: >
    Enforce final governance rule that human session logs live in /sessions/,
    RIS-scoped session artifacts live in /ris/sessions/, and the two MUST NOT mix.
    This prevents path confusion and ensures correct artifact placement.

actions:
  - step: "Scanned for misplaced session logs in ris/sessions/"
    result: "Found 1 RIS artifact (BUNDLE8_HALLUCINATION_ENGINE_V183.md) - correctly placed"
  - step: "Consolidated session templates to sessions/_template/"
    result: "Moved session-summary-v2.md from sessions/templates/ to sessions/_template/"
  - step: "Updated session-end.md guardrail"
    result: "Added explicit path enforcement: sessions/ for human logs, ris/sessions/ for RIS artifacts"
  - step: "Created ris/sessions/ structure"
    result: "Created ris/sessions/, ris/sessions/20251128/, ris/sessions/index.md, ris/sessions/_template/"
  - step: "Updated sessions/index.md"
    result: "Added path model documentation and template references"
  - step: "Created RIS session index and template"
    result: "ris/sessions/index.md and ris/sessions/_template/ris-session-template.md created"
