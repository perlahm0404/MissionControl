description: |
  Deploy KB/RIS Auto-Sync module as part of Self-Healing Governance (SHG).
  Maintains consistency between Knowledge Base (docs/kb/) and Risk Intelligence System (ris/)
  through automated index regeneration, cross-reference validation, and orphan detection.

objectives:
  - Create kb_ris_sync.md at governance/self-healing/
  - Define 4 sync targets (KB index, RIS index, cross-references, orphans)
  - Document execution flow (inventory → detect drift → sync → report)
  - Provide index templates for KB and RIS
  - Define risk classification for sync operations

acceptance_criteria:
  - governance/self-healing/kb_ris_sync.md exists and is complete
  - All 4 sync targets documented (KB index, RIS index, cross-refs, orphans)
  - Index templates provided for docs/kb/index.md and ris/index.md
  - Orphan detection and archival protocol defined
  - Risk classification matrix provided (low/medium/high)
  - Integration with orphan_scrubber.md specified

deliverables:
  - governance/self-healing/kb_ris_sync.md
  - Updated checkup.md and session-end.md commands
  - RIS task documentation (this file)

kb_refs:
  - docs/kb/index.md
  - ris/index.md

dependencies:
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-030-SHG-ENGINE
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-034-ORPHAN-SCRUBBER (for orphan archival)

next_actions:
  - Run KB/RIS sync during next /session-end
  - Verify index consistency in checkup
  - Monitor for orphaned KB/RIS files

notes: |
  KB/RIS Sync is a low-risk operation suitable for frequent execution.
  Invoked by session-end and checkup.
  All sync actions logged to PLE.
