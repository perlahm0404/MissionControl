category: governance
classification: internal

description: |
  Deploy Fingerprint Repair module as part of Self-Healing Governance (SHG).
  Validates and repairs governance fingerprint integrity after merges, conflicts,
  or structural changes. Ensures capsule, indexes, and core governance files
  maintain consistent hash signatures.

objectives:
  - Create fingerprint_repair.md at governance/self-healing/
  - Define 4 fingerprint components (capsule, indexes, core governance, cross-references)
  - Document validation protocol (compute expected → compare actual → classify → repair)
  - Provide repair actions (conflict marker removal, capsule ref update, header injection)
  - Define fingerprint log format for session summaries

acceptance_criteria:
  - governance/self-healing/fingerprint_repair.md exists and is complete
  - All 4 fingerprint components documented (capsule, indexes, governance, cross-refs)
  - Validation protocol defined in YAML
  - Repair actions provided (conflict removal, ref update, header injection)
  - Fingerprint log format specified
  - Risk classification matrix provided (low/medium/high/critical)

deliverables:
  - governance/self-healing/fingerprint_repair.md
  - Updated checkup.md and checkup-deep.md commands
  - RIS task documentation (this file)

kb_refs:
  - docs/kb/governance/fingerprint_repair_v1.8.3.md

dependencies:
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-030-SHG-ENGINE
  - GFE (Governance Fingerprint Engine) from Bundle 2

next_actions:
  - Run fingerprint validation during next /checkup
  - Monitor for conflict markers after merges
  - Deep fingerprint check weekly via /checkup-deep

notes: |
  Fingerprint Repair integrates with GFE (Governance Fingerprint Engine).
  Invoked by checkup, checkup-deep, and recovery_mode.
  All validation logged to session summary with fingerprint status.
  Critical failures (capsule missing) trigger recovery mode.
