title: Implement Golden-Flow Regression Suite
type: testing
status: completed

objective: |
  Create comprehensive golden-flow regression test suite covering critical
  end-to-end user workflows. These T3 tests gate deployments to production.

scope:
  - Login flow test
  - Provider creation/management flow test
  - License creation/management flow test
  - Compliance check flow test
  - Document upload flow test (stub version)
  - Golden-flow index and documentation

deliverables:
  - "✓ tests/simulation/goldenflow/login_flow.test"
  - "✓ tests/simulation/goldenflow/provider_creation.test"
  - "✓ tests/simulation/goldenflow/license_creation.test"
  - "✓ tests/simulation/goldenflow/compliance_check.test"
  - "✓ tests/simulation/goldenflow/document_upload_stub.test"
  - "✓ tests/simulation/goldenflow/goldenflow_index.md"

test_coverage:
  login_flow:
    steps: 5
    validations: ["valid credentials → token", "invalid → 401", "missing fields → 422"]
  provider_creation:
    steps: 8
    validations: ["CRUD operations", "duplicate prevention", "validation errors"]
  license_creation:
    steps: 8
    validations: ["CRUD operations", "expiration handling", "duplicate prevention"]
  compliance_check:
    steps: 7
    validations: ["async task execution", "report generation", "error handling"]
  document_upload:
    steps: 8
    validations: ["file upload", "size limits", "type validation"]

success_criteria:
  - All 5 golden-flow tests defined
  - All tests executable (implementation TBD for full version)
  - Integrated into pr-goldenflow.yml workflow
  - Documentation complete

enforcement:
  - T3 level (deploy-blocking)
  - Must pass before production deployment
  - Run on merge to main
  - Re-run on pre-deploy

references:
  - tests/simulation/goldenflow/goldenflow_index.md
  - .github/workflows/pr-goldenflow.yml
  - governance/testing/testing_engine.md

notes:
  - Document upload test is stub version (no Bedrock integration)
  - Full implementation requires backend API completion
  - Tests are defined; implementation follows in subsequent tasks
