description: |
  Deploy Session Ledger Healing module as part of Self-Healing Governance (SHG).
  Detects and repairs incomplete sessions, orphaned summaries, missing ledger entries,
  and crashed sessions. Triggers recovery mode when needed.

objectives:
  - Create session_ledger_healing.md at governance/self-healing/
  - Define 4 healing capabilities (incomplete sessions, orphaned summaries, missing entries, crashed sessions)
  - Document execution flow (scan → classify → heal → report)
  - Integrate with recovery_mode.md for crash recovery
  - Define risk classification for auto-healing

acceptance_criteria:
  - governance/self-healing/session_ledger_healing.md exists and is complete
  - All 4 healing capabilities documented with auto-fix actions
  - Session ledger structure documented (sessions/YYYYMMDD/)
  - Recovery protocol defined for crashed sessions
  - Risk classification matrix provided
  - Integration with recovery_mode.md specified

deliverables:
  - governance/self-healing/session_ledger_healing.md
  - Updated session-start.md and session-end.md commands
  - RIS task documentation (this file)

kb_refs:
  - docs/kb/governance/session_ledger_healing_v1.8.3.md

dependencies:
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-030-SHG-ENGINE
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-035-RECOVERY-MODE (for crash recovery integration)

next_actions:
  - Run session ledger healing during next /session-start
  - Monitor for crashed session detection
  - Review interrupted sessions monthly

notes: |
  Session Ledger Healing is critical for maintaining governance audit trail integrity.
  Invoked by session-start and checkup-deep.
  All healing actions logged to PLE.
