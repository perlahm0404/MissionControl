context:
  problem: |
    Need lightweight alternative to /claire for quick session initialization.
    /claire triggers full session lifecycle hooks (repo scan, metadata registration, etc.).
    Sometimes users just need minimal Claire activation without ceremony.

  scope:
    - Create .claude/commands/boot.md with single-line zero-waste bootloader
    - Register /boot in Capsule v1.8.2 as official command
    - Document /boot vs /claire differences in Capsule
    - Create KB article: docs/kb/orchestration/bootloader.md
    - Create RIS entry for governance tracking

  references:
    - .claude/commands/boot.md (new command file)
    - governance/capsule-v1.8.2.md (updated with /boot registry)
    - docs/kb/orchestration/bootloader.md (new KB article)
    - zBOOTLOADER.md (source for boot content)

dependencies: []

acceptance_criteria:
  - boot.md created with zero-waste single-line activation text
  - Capsule v1.8.2 updated with Section 15: Official Commands Registry
  - /boot registered as system-level session initializer
  - /boot vs /claire difference documented in Capsule
  - KB article created explaining bootloader usage
  - RIS entry created for governance impact tracking

implementation_steps:
  - step: 1
    action: "Create .claude/commands/boot.md"
    content: "Single-line zero-waste bootloader from zBOOTLOADER.md"
    path: ".claude/commands/boot.md"
    status: completed

  - step: 2
    action: "Update Capsule v1.8.2 with /boot registry"
    changes:
      - Added Section 15: Official Commands Registry
      - Registered /boot as official command
      - Documented /boot vs /claire differences
      - Defined /boot as system-level session initializer
    path: "governance/capsule-v1.8.2.md"
    status: completed

  - step: 3
    action: "Create RIS entry"
    path: "ris/tasks/RIS-TASK-GOV-007-BOOTLOADER-COMMAND.yaml"
    status: completed

  - step: 4
    action: "Create KB article"
    path: "docs/kb/orchestration/bootloader.md"
    status: pending

  - step: 5
    action: "Update commands index (if present)"
    status: pending

validation:
  - boot.md exists at .claude/commands/boot.md
  - Capsule v1.8.2 contains Section 15 with /boot registry
  - KB article created at docs/kb/orchestration/bootloader.md
  - RIS entry created
  - Commands index updated (if applicable)

governance_impact:
  area: command_system
  changes:
    - Added new system-level command: /boot
    - Extended Capsule v1.8.2 with Official Commands Registry (Section 15)
    - Defined clear distinction between /boot and /claire
  rationale: |
    /boot provides minimal activation for quick sessions without full lifecycle overhead.
    Useful for rapid prototyping, quick fixes, or when full session ceremony is unnecessary.
    Does not replace /claire; complements it as lightweight alternative.

notes: |
  /boot Command Behavior:
  - Loads Capsule v1.8.2
  - Activates Claire as orchestrator
  - Enforces nondestructive mode, RIS+KB integration, boundaries
  - NO repo scan, NO session metadata registration, NO summary template
  - Response: "Claire v1.8.2 active."

  /claire Command Behavior:
  - Loads Capsule v1.8.2
  - Activates Claire with full session lifecycle hooks
  - Scans repo for drift, problems, blockers
  - Registers session metadata and summary template
  - Response: Detailed start-of-session report

  Design Decision: Keep /boot ultra-minimal to reduce cognitive load for
  quick sessions while preserving /claire for production-grade workflows.
