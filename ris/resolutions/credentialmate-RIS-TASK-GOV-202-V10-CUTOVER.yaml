## Summary

Successfully executed governance v10 cutover, establishing `docs/governance/active/` as the SINGLE ACTIVE governance source. All legacy governance (v1.8.x and earlier) quarantined to read-only reference location.

## Problem Statement

**Issue**: Dual governance systems created confusion and drift risk:
- `governance/v10/` (new structure, claimed to be v1.8.2)
- Scattered legacy governance (v1.8.x) in `docs/kb/governance/`, `lanes/governance/`, etc.

**Impact**:
- Version ambiguity (v10 capsule claimed to be v1.8.2)
- Multiple potential sources of truth
- Risk of loading wrong governance files
- Inconsistent governance references across codebase

## Implementation

### Recovery Process

Work was interrupted mid-cutover with mixed governance + agent SDK + parser/worker changes. Executed controlled recovery plan:

1. **Safety snapshot**: Created `safety/gov-v10-mixed-state-20251130` branch
2. **Branch split**: Separated mixed work into three independent branches
3. **Test fixes**: Fixed golden test doc_type naming mismatches
4. **Verification**: All pre-merge checks passed
5. **Merge**: Three separate PRs merged to main

### Filesystem Changes

**Moved to ACTIVE**:
- `governance/v10/*` → `docs/governance/active/` (16 files)

**Moved to LEGACY**:
- `docs/kb/governance/*` → `docs/governance/legacy/v1.8.x/kb/` (67 files)
- `docs/governance/*.md` → `docs/governance/legacy/v1.8.x/docs-governance/` (6 files)
- `lanes/governance/*` → `docs/governance/legacy/v1.8.x/lanes/` (3 files)

**Created**:
- `docs/governance/legacy/v1.8.x/README.md` (legacy boundary documentation)
- `tests/governance/test_governance_integrity.py` (5 governance tests)
- `.github/workflows/governance-integrity.yml` (CI enforcement)

### Content Changes

1. **Updated** `docs/governance/active/capsule-v10.0.md`:
   - Fixed version claim (v1.8.2 → v10.0)
   - Added Governance Source Truth section with ACTIVE/FORBIDDEN paths

2. **Updated** `docs/governance/active/index.md`:
   - Marked v10.0 as ACTIVE
   - Added Legacy Governance section
   - Documented legacy boundary

3. **Updated** `.claude/commands/claire.md`:
   - Changed all paths from `governance/v10/` → `docs/governance/active/`
   - Added FORBIDDEN legacy paths rule

4. **Updated** `.claude/commands/load-governance.md`:
   - Rewrote to load only v10.0 ACTIVE governance
   - Excluded all legacy paths

### CI Enforcement

Created governance integrity workflow (`.github/workflows/governance-integrity.yml`):
- Runs on all PRs touching governance files
- 5 tests enforcing v10 cutover rules:
  1. Only ONE capsule marked ACTIVE
  2. No legacy markers in ACTIVE governance
  3. No legacy paths in governance loaders
  4. ACTIVE governance structure exists
  5. LEGACY governance structure exists

## Testing

### Governance Integrity Tests

All 5 tests passing:
```
✅ test_only_one_active_capsule
✅ test_no_legacy_markers_in_active
✅ test_no_legacy_paths_in_loaders
✅ test_active_governance_structure
✅ test_legacy_governance_structure
```

### Manual Verification

- ✅ Only ONE capsule marked ACTIVE (`docs/governance/active/capsule-v10.0.md`)
- ✅ Legacy files preserved in `docs/governance/legacy/v1.8.x/`
- ✅ Claire loads v10.0 only (verified `.claude/commands/claire.md`)
- ✅ No legacy paths in governance loaders
- ✅ CI workflow created and enforcing

## Success Criteria

- [x] Single ACTIVE governance source established
- [x] All legacy governance quarantined to read-only location
- [x] Governance version ambiguity resolved (v10.0 clearly marked)
- [x] CI enforcement in place (governance integrity workflow)
- [x] Zero breaking changes (all legacy files preserved)
- [x] Complete documentation (discovery, migration, recovery)

## Safety & Rollback

**Safety snapshot preserved**: `safety/gov-v10-mixed-state-20251130`
- Contains complete mixed state before split
- Pushed to remote for 30-day retention
- Available for rollback if needed

**Rollback strategy**: Cherry-pick from safety snapshot or reset to pre-merge commit

## Breaking Changes

None. All legacy files preserved in `docs/governance/legacy/` for historical reference.

## Compliance

- ✅ Capsule v10.0 governed
- ✅ Phase 7 constraints enforced (non-destructive)
- ✅ FPG compliant (correct directory placement)
- ✅ RIS tracked (this task)
- ✅ Session logged (recovery sessions documented)
