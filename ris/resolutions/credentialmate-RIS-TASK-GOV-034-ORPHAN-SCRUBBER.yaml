  Deploy Orphan Scrubber module as part of Self-Healing Governance (SHG).
  Identifies and archives ambiguous, obsolete, or misplaced files to zdelete/orphan/
  with full manifest tracking and recovery capability.

  - Document scrubbing process (scan → classify → archive → report)
  - Implement orphan manifest format (zdelete/orphan/manifest.md)
  - Provide recovery protocol for archived files

acceptance_criteria:
  - governance/self-healing/orphan_scrubber.md exists and is complete
  - All 5 orphan categories documented with archival rules
  - Scrubbing process defined in YAML
  - Manifest format specified with recovery commands
  - Risk classification matrix provided (low/medium/high)
  - Safety guardrails documented (git mv only, no destructive deletes)

deliverables:
  - governance/self-healing/orphan_scrubber.md
  - zdelete/orphan/manifest.md template
  - Updated checkup-deep.md command
  - RIS task documentation (this file)

kb_refs:
  - zdelete/orphan/manifest.md

dependencies:
  - RIS-TASK-GOV-030-SHG-ENGINE
  - File Placement Governance (FPG) in capsule v1.8.3

next_actions:
  - Run orphan scrub during next /checkup-deep
  - Review orphan manifest monthly for false positives
  - Archive old orphans (>180 days) after team review

notes: |
  Orphan Scrubber is a medium-risk operation requiring careful manifest tracking.
  All moves use git mv (preserves history).
  Invoked by checkup-deep only.
  All archival actions logged to PLE and manifest.
