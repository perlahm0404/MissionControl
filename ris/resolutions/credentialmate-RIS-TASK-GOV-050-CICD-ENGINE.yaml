# CI/CD Governance Engine Installation

## Objective
Install Bundle 5 — CI/CD Governance Layer with validation, gating, provenance, and drift protection.

## Scope
- .github/workflows/ creation
- 7 CI/CD workflows
- Command updates (work, session-end, checkup-deep)
- KB documentation
- Integration with Bundle 2 (PLE, GFE) and Bundle 3 (SHG)

## Implementation

### Workflows Created
1. **pr-validate.yml**: PR validation (capsule, FPG, builds, lints, typechecks)
2. **pr-secretscan.yml**: Secrets governance (scan diffs for AWS keys, JWT secrets, passwords)
3. **pr-driftscan.yml**: Drift scan (FPG validation, index checks, capsule checksum, fingerprint)
4. **pr-goldenflow.yml**: Golden flow E2E smoke test
5. **pr-kb-ris-sync.yml**: KB/RIS sync validation (governance changes have docs)
6. **deploy-staging.yml**: Manual-gated staging deployment with provenance
7. **deploy-prod.yml**: Manual-gated production deployment with provenance

### Command Updates
- `.claude/commands/work.md`: Added CI/CD gate awareness
- `.claude/commands/session-end.md`: Added CI/CD gate validation before push
- `.claude/commands/checkup-deep.md`: Added CI/CD gate audit

### Integration Points
- **PLE**: CI gate failures logged to provenance ledger
- **GFE**: Fingerprint validation in drift scan
- **SHG**: Auto-repair drift before CI gates run
- **Task Classification**: CI operations classified as T1

## Validation
- [x] 7 workflows created in .github/workflows/
- [x] Commands updated with CI/CD awareness
- [x] Integration with Bundle 2 engines (PLE, GFE)
- [x] Integration with Bundle 3 (SHG)
- [x] KB entries created
- [x] RIS tasks created
