summary: |
  Add PEAO Section X to Capsule governance as patch v1.8.8.
  PEAO enables supervised, human-approved temporary overrides for high-friction
  production operations while maintaining auditability and safety controls.

justification: |
  PEAO is required to enable supervised, human-approved temporary overrides for
  high-friction production operations such as AWS SSM work, deployment checks,
  and incident response. All overrides remain gated by human approval, mandatory
  RIS logging, single-use expiry, and existing SOC2/HIPAA controls. This expands
  operational safety while maintaining auditability and traceability.

scope:
  - governance/capsule-v1.8.2.md (append patch v1.8.8)
  - .claude/commands/claire.md (reference update)

change_plan:
  - Create capsule patch v1.8.8 draft
  - Human reviews draft
  - If approved, append to capsule
  - Update Claire orchestrator reference

rollback_plan: |
  Remove patch v1.8.8 section from capsule.
  Revert Claire orchestrator reference.
  Create RIS entry documenting rollback.

non_bypassable_controls:
  - Secrets redaction
  - SSM-only access for production workloads
  - RIS logging and ledger capture
  - IAM role boundaries
  - No plaintext passwords or AWS creds in prompts
  - No bypass of SOC2/HIPAA enforcement layers

bypassable_with_approval:
  - Capsule phase sequencing
  - Context reconstruction failures
  - Missing-resource blockers
  - Preflight warnings
  - Production-touch restrictions (non-security gates only)
  - Multi-step confirmations
  - Non-critical validation checks
  - Read-only mode
  - Guardrails restricting historical searches

safety_requirements:
  - Human approval required every invocation
  - Mandatory RIS Incident Alert per override
  - Mandatory RIS Decision Record per override
  - Single-operation expiry (automatic reset)
  - Approval block validation (all fields required)

governance_reference:
  capsule_version: v1.8.2
