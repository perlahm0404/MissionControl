# Golden Flow E2E Pipeline

## Objective
Implement E2E smoke test for critical user flows before merge to main.

## Workflow
.github/workflows/pr-goldenflow.yml

## Test Flows (Stubs)
1. Login
2. Create provider
3. Create license
4. Compliance check
5. Document upload

## Behavior
- Trigger on PRs to main
- Setup test environment (postgres, redis)
- Run golden flow smoke tests
- Clean up environment
- Block merge on failure

## Future Enhancement
Replace stubs with actual E2E tests using Playwright/Cypress.
