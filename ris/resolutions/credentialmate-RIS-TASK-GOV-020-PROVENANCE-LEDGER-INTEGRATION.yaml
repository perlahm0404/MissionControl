# Provenance Ledger Engine (PLE) Integration

## Objective
Integrate Provenance Ledger Engine (PLE) into all orchestration commands to maintain SOC2-grade, append-only provenance for all agent activity.

## Scope
- /work.md
- /session-start.md
- /session-end.md
- /checkup.md
- /checkup-deep.md

## Implementation

### PLE Features Integrated
1. **Ledger Location**: governance/provenance/ledger/YYYYMMDD_SESSIONID.log
2. **Ledger Fields**: timestamp, actor:claire, action, files, branch, ris, kb, diff_summary, drift_flags, classification, push_status, pr_url, notes
3. **Auto-Append Hooks**: Trigger on file write/edit/delete/commit/push/PR operations
4. **Session Tracking**: Start, mid-session, and end provenance logging

### Commands Modified
- **.claude/work.md**: Added PLE boot, session start logging, hook registration
- **.claude/commands/session-start.md**: Added PLE ledger creation, initial entry, hooks
- **.claude/commands/session-end.md**: Added PLE summary read, final validation logging, git operation logging
- **.claude/commands/checkup.md**: Added PLE ledger read for active sessions
- **.claude/commands/checkup-deep.md**: Added PLE audit for ledger completeness

## Validation
- [x] PLE referenced in all 5 orchestration commands
- [x] Ledger creation on session start
- [x] Append hooks registered
- [x] Git operations logged (commit, push, PR)
- [x] Governance sweep results logged
- [x] Machine-readable output includes classification_status
