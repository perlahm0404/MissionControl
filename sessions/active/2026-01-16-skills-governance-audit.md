# Session: 2026-01-16 - Skills Governance Audit

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Focus Area**: READ-ONLY governance analysis of skills across repositories

## Code Status

- **TypeScript**: N/A (read-only session)
- **Lint**: N/A (read-only session)
- **Tests**: N/A (read-only session)
- **Security**: OK (no code modifications)

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Skills Inventory** - Catalogued 36 skills across 3 repositories:
   - AI_Orchestrator: 6 skills
   - KareMatch: 23 skills
   - CredentialMate: 7 skills (including session-close duplicate)

2. **Governance Classification** - Classified all skills into boundaries:
   - MISSION-CONTROL: 14 skills (39%) - Generic, reusable, cross-app
   - APP-LOCAL: 19 skills (53%) - Intentionally coupled to specific apps
   - EMERGENCY-ONLY: 3 skills (8%) - High authority break-glass operations

3. **Risk Assessment** - Identified:
   - 6 ambiguities in skill definitions
   - 8 missing sections across skills
   - 6 over-coupling concerns
   - 7 governance risks (2 HIGH severity)
   - 7 SSOT violations

4. **MissionControl Commit** - Pushed 190 files including:
   - Skills analysis documentation
   - Skills governance classification
   - 170+ RIS resolution files
   - Governance policies and protocols
   - Session documentation

## What Was NOT Done

- No code modifications (READ-ONLY session)
- No skill refactoring
- No implementation proposals
- No schema changes

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/architecture/skills-governance-classification.md` | Boundary classification for all 36 skills |

## Key Decisions Made

- **Classification Boundaries**: Used MISSION-CONTROL / APP-LOCAL / EMERGENCY-ONLY as governance buckets
- **Authority Levels**: Documented L1-L4 where defined, marked Unknown otherwise
- **Location Mismatches**: Identified 9 skills whose current location doesn't match their boundary

## Governance Observations

### High-Risk Findings

1. **deploy-ec2-fallback**: L4 authority with no explicit approval gate
2. **rollback-lambda**: Can modify production Lambda alias without documented approval
3. **EMERGENCY-ONLY skills concentrated in CredentialMate**: No equivalent for KareMatch

### SSOT Concerns

- `session-close` duplicated across AI_Orchestrator and KareMatch with different structures
- No single authoritative version designated
- 8 MISSION-CONTROL skills located in KareMatch instead of shared location

## Commits

| Hash | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `c89a155` | docs: add skills governance classification analysis |
| `c590924` | docs: add governance artifacts, RIS resolutions, and session files |

## Next Steps

1. Human decision needed on session-close SSOT ownership
2. Human decision on relocating MISSION-CONTROL skills to shared location
3. Human decision on adding approval gates to EMERGENCY-ONLY skills

## Handoff Notes

This was a READ-ONLY governance audit session. No code was modified. The primary deliverable is the skills governance classification document at `docs/architecture/skills-governance-classification.md` which maps all 36 skills to governance boundaries.

Key finding: 39% of skills (14) are classified as MISSION-CONTROL (shareable) but 8 of those are currently located in KareMatch rather than a shared location. This represents a structural inconsistency that may warrant future consolidation.

The 3 EMERGENCY-ONLY skills (deploy-ec2-fallback, rollback-lambda, hotfix-chain) all reside in CredentialMate and lack explicit human approval gates documented in their skill definitions.
